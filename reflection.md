# Reflection

## What worked well?
I feel like the quizzes at the start of each lesson were a significant help. They introduced new concepts and allowed to gain a better understanding of concepts that were already introduced. Snakify also helped with this, allowing the student to work ahead and learn concepts that are useful in quizzes and projects.
## What did not work well?
Making the flowcharts was often tedious and took more time than making the code itself. I have gotten better at it over time though, and I can see its usefullness.
## What is your goal for unit 2?
Start doing snakify again and start development on the 2nd project earlier.
## How do you plan on achieving that goal?
Have better time management and start working on the project as soon as I know the details.
